/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Rewrite the function using curly braces
 *    for the function body and an explicit
 *    return statement.
 *
 * 2) Run the program to check the output
 *    is unaffected by the change in form.
 *
 * Do you prefer the function with or without
 * the return statement?
